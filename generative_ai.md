semi-supervised learning: model is trained on a **small** amount of labelled data and a **large** amount of unlabeled data. 
The labelled data helps to learn the task, the unlabelled data helps to generalize to new examples. 

Large Language Models are a subset of Deep Learning.
Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning. 

Gen AI is a type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.

ML models can be divided into two types: 
- generative models: 
    - learns $P(X,Y)$
    - learns to generate new data instances based on the learned probability distribution of the training dataset.
- discriminative models: 
    - used to predict outputs for new data
    - learns $P(Y|X)$
    - learns to predict labels or continuous output values (regression and classification)

The power of Gen AI comes from the use of Transformers.
